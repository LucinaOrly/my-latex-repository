John Cage's reliance on philosophy
	Southeast Asian philosophy(Zen Buddhism, D.T. Suzuki), Indian aesthetics, and the works of Coomaraswamy" (p. 2)

1957 lecture "Experimental Music"
	"he described music as 'a purposeless play' which is 'an affirmation of life - not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living'(p. 2)

John Cages "INDETERMINACY"
	"The most common understanding of the term is applied to works that are indeterminate in their composition, or, in other words, are composed using change operations. Cage experimented with a number of chance-generating devices (rolling dice, magic squares, etc.) until Christian Wolff gave him a copy of the I Ching in 1951." (pg. 3)
		I Ching / Book of Changes: ancient Chinese text for divination purposes. 64 possible hexagrams. "Cage connected this practice to the Zen Buddhist ideal of removing the ego from his creative work"
